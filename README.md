$$Introduction$$

we demonstrated how to use PuLP, a Python library, to set
up and solve a linear programming problem.
Linear programming is a powerful technique for optimizing various real-world
problems with linear relationships.
With PuLP, you can easily model and solve linear programming problems in
Python.
