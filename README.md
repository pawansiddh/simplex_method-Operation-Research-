$$Introduction$$

we demonstrated how to use PuLP, a Python library, to set
up and solve a linear programming problem.
Linear programming is a powerful technique for optimizing various real-world
problems with linear relationships.
With PuLP, you can easily model and solve linear programming problems in
Python.

 $$Here we take a example of simplex method$$
   $$Zmax=X1+3X2;$$
   $$constraint1:3X1+6X2 <= 8;$$
   $$constraint2:5X1+2X2 <=10$$
   $$where X1 and X2 are >=0$$
